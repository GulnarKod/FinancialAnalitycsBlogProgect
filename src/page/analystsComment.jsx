                <p className='commentToArticle_text'>Over long periods of time the market reflects the gradual growth of the larger economy.\nBut many people want to  be rich now, or beat the average. This is gambling. It is based on a few stocks for a short period of time, and assumes all the other traders are rational in some way. \nIn the short term the market acts like a herd of cows: always looking to stampede in some direction. In the long run the cows always return to the barn.\nSo, be aware that gambling and a sure bet operate at different time scales. I have no interest in learning enough about any stock, to make day trades.
                    And investing for the long term has more than doubled my money.
